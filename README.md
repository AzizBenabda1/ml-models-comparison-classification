Car Insurance Premium Prediction
Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project to predict car insurance premiums using driver and vehicle features. The dataset includes attributes like driver age, experience, previous accidents, annual mileage, car manufacturing year, car age, and insurance premiums. The project is in its early stages, focusing on data loading and initial inspection, with plans for preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model development.
Repository Structure

netoyageDataSetarbre5_(1).ipynb: Jupyter notebook for data loading and initial exploration.
car_insurance_premium_dataset.csv: Dataset file (not included; must be sourced separately).
README.md: This documentation file.

Dataset
The dataset (car_insurance_premium_dataset.csv) contains the following features:

Driver Age: Age of the driver (numeric).
Driver Experience: Years of driving experience (numeric).
Previous Accidents: Number of prior accidents (numeric).
Annual Mileage (x1000 km): Annual mileage in thousands of kilometers (numeric).
Car Manufacturing Year: Year the car was manufactured (numeric).
Car Age: Age of the car in years (numeric).
Insurance Premium ($): Target variable, premium amount in dollars (numeric).

Planned Steps

Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values and outliers.
Validate data consistency (e.g., correct future dates like 2025 in Car Manufacturing Year).


Exploratory Data Analysis:
Visualize feature distributions and correlations.
Identify key predictors of insurance premiums.


Feature Engineering:
Scale numerical features.
Create derived features if needed.


Model Development:
Train regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest).
Evaluate performance using metrics like RMSE and RÂ².


Model Optimization:
Tune hyperparameters.
Address model performance issues.


Documentation:
Update this README with final results and deployment instructions.
